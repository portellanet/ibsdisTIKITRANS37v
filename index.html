			<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>Transfer is booked in advance</p>
			The carrier knows beforehand when you arrive at the airport: the taxi will already be waiting for you at the taxi rank, and the taxi driver will meet you as close to the arrivals area as the airport rules allow. The same applies to transfers from train stations and hotels: the driver will be waiting for you at the specified place, holding a sign with a client’s name on it — this is a standard of our service. It is possible to order a local taxi to the airport cheaply (taxi rates are normally lower than transfer prices), but you will have to wait for the taxi cab and then look for it, which may take 10–15 minutes more than in case of a pre-booking.
			<p>If need be, the car will be equipped with a child seat</p>
			When booking a vehicle with us, it is sufficient to specify how many child seats you need and for what age. The price for a seat will be automatically added to the total amount on the payment page. The driver will arrive in a car prepared for children transportation. If you try to order a taxi to the airport on the spot and ask for a car with 1-2 child seats, you may have to wait no less than 15 minutes, while the operator will be searching for the options to find nothing.
			<p>Travel with bulky baggage</p>
			You only need to book a transfer, having specified in a booking form that you need a big trunk for skis. Your order will be confirmed only provided the carrier finds a car, in which one can transport skis, otherwise, you will know, that in this area such a vehicle cannot be provided.
			<p>The car of a chosen car class</p>
			Or of a higher class. The capacity is known in advance: how many people can travel and how many standard-size suitcases can fit in. When booking a taxi cab from the airport via a local app, this cannot always be predicted.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>No need to communicate with a driver</p>
			Everything about the trip is known in advance, so if you do not speak the language or are not in a mood, you do not have to talk. A driver holding a sign with a passenger’s name on it will meet you in the right place and the rest is recorded in a voucher. You will probably have to argue with a local taxi driver over the price of a taxi from the airport — in a foreign language, you may fail to bargain successfully.]
			<p>You can have a small excursion</p>
			We try to allocate English-speaking drivers to the bookings. So, you can easily ask him/her about the country and the city. The transfer, in the first place, is a tourist service. Professional drivers understand it and do their best to let a tourist enjoy his/her time during the trip.]
			<p>Taxi to the airport at a fixed price</p>
			The payment is possible in a favorable currency on the website. The rates for our service are known in advance. After making a booking, the price will not change, no matter how much time is left before the trip. For a trip by public transport or local taxi from the airport, you will have to exchange currency upon arrival, and the price is not known in advance.
